To start anything in gray the viewer of this webpage will not see.

How to edit this document:
There are several tags in this document and some styling information as well.  I will not talk about the styling
because that is not neccessary for you to know about at this point in time.

The tags are as follows
<body> this tag is where content for the webpage belongs
<ul> this means the content is in an unorganized list or bulleted
<li> this means it is a list item there will be a bullet infront of it
<br> this menas break which causes there to be a blank line of text like hitting enter twice
		the break helps provide us with some spacing
<a> is for creating a link to a document or webpage

Tags must get closed by simply adding a / infront of the type of tag such as </li> would be to close a list item
The only exception to this rule is as break tag wich only needs to be opened not closed.

Tags must always be opened and closed in a cascading style. as shown below

<body>
	<ul>
		<li>
		</li>
		<br>
		<li>
			<a>
			</a>
		</li>
	</ul>
</body>

How do I get the viewer to see texted on the webpage?

	the content inbewteen a tag is what the viewer of the finished webpage will see. 
	for example if I want them to see "happy birthday" in as a list item it would look like this
	<body>
		<ul>
			<li>
				happy birthday
			</li>
		</Ul>
	</body>

	this would cause the user to see happy birthday with a bullet infront of it.

How do I get the viewer to see a link on the webpage?
	
	a link is created by using the <a> tag
	if I wanted to go to google my linke would look like this
	<a href="http://google.com"></a>
	Notice the parenthesis around the URL for the website
	This would just provide a link with no text telling the user where they will be going
	
	in order to tell the user where they will be going insert texted between the open and close <a> tag.
	all of the texted inside the tag will become a clickable link
	here is how I get to google again but this time I will tell the user that it is a link to google
	<a href="http://google.com">link to google</a>
	
	Lastly what if I wanted to insert a link into a paragraph of text.  for example I want to say
	"Click here to access google"
	If i only want the word google to be the link it would look like this
	<body>
		<ul>
			<li>
				Click here to access <a href="http://google.com">google</a>
			</li>
		</Ul>
	</body>
